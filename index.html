                            Jersey girl, born and bred. I grew up on the waters of the Jersey Shore, no, not like the show, the one where Bruce Springsteen, Jon Bon Jovi, Charlie Puth, Queen Latifah, Joe Pesci, Jon Stewart, Jack Nicholson and Danny Devito grew up. Where the beaches are hot and so is everyone's temper. Here is where I developed my grit. I grew up in a family of Entrepreneurs. Growing up, my brothers and I were the kids on the block to wake up early and make lemonade and cookies to sell on the curb. The kids to buy cooler school supplies in bulk and sell to friends on the playground in middle school. The kids to offer services in high school to help train other kids for their next sport season. We’ve always been good at taking something we were good at and cashing in on it. At these young ages, our intention was to make money. To no surprise, as adults, we have tried to figure out ways to start our own businesses so we can cash in on what we know we can execute. But as an adult, these goals don’t come as easily. We realized we can’t just start a business to make money, we NEED to do something that we would go broke for, something that we would sacrifice for.
